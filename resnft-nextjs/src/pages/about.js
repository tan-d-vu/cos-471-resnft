            ResNFT is a NFT minting and trading platform designed specifically
            for restaurant reservations. We created this platform for restaurants to 
            turn their deposit based reservations into resaleable and tradeable 
            NFTs. Now restaurants can make royalties as reservations change hands and 
            last minute reservation changes don't have to lead to a deposit loss for 
            customers.
